			<p style="text-align:justify">The real-life effects of chaos theory can be seen in the nature of weather prediction. Since the 1920s, scientists have used numerical models to predict future weather based on current conditions. However, computer simulations reveal that when initial conditions are adjusted even by amounts smaller than observational uncertainty, the resulting weather patterns quickly diverge from the control. Because meteorological tools to measure temperature, pressure, wind speeds, etc. are not infinitely precise, the weather can only be accurately forecasted a few days in advance (Buizza 1-3).</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">This is an example of an easily replicable chaotic system. A magnetic pendulum is suspended over three or more equally spaced magnets of equal strength. Various computer models have shown that which magnet the mass stops at is entirely dependent on its beginning location. Furthermore, each distinct starting position results in the pendulum taking a different path before coming to rest. Graphing final location as a function of starting location for the pendulum shows that patterns hold true as the scale becomes infinitesimal, demonstrating the close relationship between fractals and chaos (Berg).</p>

			<p style="text-align:justify">Keeping track of Nix and Hydra, two of Pluto's moons, has convinced astronomers that their orbits are chaotic, unlike our own moon. This is theorized to be mainly due to their irregular shape. Similar to with other chaotic systems, scientists are seeking to understand these orbits with the help of computer simulations (ESA/Hubble). </p>
