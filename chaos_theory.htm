			Chaos Theory is the study of the behavior of chaotic systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			Chaotic systems are thought of in terms of their state (set of dependent variables, e.g., position and momentum) at a given value of an independent variable, usually time. 
		</p>
		<hr>
		<p>
			All of these systems exhibit certain properties. Chaotic systems are...

		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Aperiodic</strong></dt>
			<dd>The trajectory of the state of a chaotic system over time is not cyclic and does not follow patterns. It often appears random.</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Deterministic</strong></dt>
			<dd>The trajectory of the state of a chaotic system is wholly dependent on its initial state, and can be calculated via a series of equations using the initial state; thus, chaotic systems are not random, as a given initial state will always output the same state trajectory.</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Dynamical</strong></dt>
			<dd>Each possible state of a chaotic system will result from one and only one initial state; thus, no unique state can result from multiple initial states.</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>have SDIC (Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions)</strong></dt>
			<dd>Given two chaotic systems with identical series of equations, a seemingly negligible difference between initial states results in significantly different state trajectories; thus, accurately predicting chaotic systems is abnormally dependent on measurement accuracy.<dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Nonlinear</strong></dt>
			<dd>Changing the initial state of a chaotic system may not result in a state trajectory proportional to that change</dd>
			<br>
			<dt><strong>Attracted</strong></dt>
			<dd>The state trajectory of a chaotic system is affected by strange attractors, each of which pulls the state trajectory towards the attractorâ€™s trajectory; thus, many chaotic systems approach cyclic behavior, while some systems affected by multiple attractors do not.</dd>

		<p>Chaos Theory and the properties of chaotic systems have many philosophical implications, including those regarding the following:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Determinism</strong>
				<ul>
					<br>
					<li class=u>In a philosophical context, determinism refers to the idea that any given event was caused by another, and that event by another, and so on, such that every event is determined by the initial state of the universe.</li>
					<br>
					<li class=u>Some arguments against determinism argue that, because many real chaotic processes appear random, the universe cannot be deterministic; however, because chaotic systems are deterministic, chaos theory serves to only to further disprove indeterminism and randomness on a nonquantum scale.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li><strong>Free Will</strong>
				<ul>
					<br>
					<li class=u>Free will refers to the idea of a given being, e.g., humans, having agency in their actions; that is, the being decides on and commits to an action independent from external influences</li>
					<br>
					<li class=u>The human brain, composed of neurons communicating with one another via electric pulses, is likely a chaotic system, since neurons are affected by one another and external stimuli, it acts largely aperiodically, and resembles attraction as commonly charged neuron paths are strengthened and made more affective over time.</li>
					<br>
					<li class=u>Assuming the human brain is chaotic, and knowing chaotic systems are deterministic, it is probable that the human brain is deterministic. This would mean all neuron firings, and all human decisions by extension, are determined exclusively by its initial state (genetically) and by external stimuli. </li>
				</ul>
